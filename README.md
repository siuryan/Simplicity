Airline simulator game for APCS2 final project

## Description
Welcome to our airline game! In this game, you are the owner of an airline company and you get to choose your own flight routes between different cities! You start out with some money and an airplane and your goal is to make more money by starting new flight routes. With the money you earn, you can buy better airplanes with greater efficiency and range and you can also unlock cities with higher populations. The profit you gain from each flight is determined by the size of the city and the capacity of your airplanes, so your goal is to buy the best airplanes and unlock the biggest cities. 

## How it Works
Our game works by creating sets of cities, airplanes, and flight routes that the user possesses and adding to them as the game progresses. The flight routes available to the user are generated based on the shortest connections to each city from each possible starting city by pathfinding from each starting point.


## Instructions
There are two versions of this game: a Processing GUI version with the latest features, and a terminal, text-based version that was developed for testing. The terminal version may not have all the features contained in the GUI version, and may contain bugs.

To run the GUI version:
1. Open ```Driver.pde``` in the ```Driver``` directory, contained in the root of this repo.
2. Press run. Enjoy!

To run the terminal version:
1. Move or copy ```Driver.java```, contained in the ```terminal``` directory, to the ```Driver``` directory.
2. Compile ```Driver.java```.
3. ```java Driver``` to run.
