## Description

## How it Works

## Instructions
There are two versions of this game: a Processing GUI version with the latest features, and a terminal, text-based version that was developed for testing. The terminal version may not have all the features contained in the GUI version, and may contain bugs.

To run the GUI version:
1. Open ```Driver.pde``` in the ```Driver``` directory, contained in the root of this repo.
2. Press run. Enjoy!

To run the terminal version:
1. Move or copy ```Driver.java```, contained in the ```terminal``` directory, to the ```Driver``` directory.
2. Compile ```Driver.java```.
3. ```java Driver``` to run.
